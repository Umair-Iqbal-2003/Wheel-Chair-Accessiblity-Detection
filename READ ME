# Wheelchair Accessibility Detection  

## Inspiration  
The idea for this project was inspired by a personal experience during my (Umair Iqbal) pilgrimage to Makkah. Throughout the journey, I pushed my grandmother’s wheelchair, facing immense challenges navigating spaces that were not always accessible. This experience highlighted the need for a tool that could make accessibility easier, more intuitive, and empower individuals to navigate spaces with confidence.  

## What It Does  
Wheelchair Accessibility Detection provides an AI-powered solution to assess the accessibility of public spaces. By analyzing photos of a location, the tool identifies key accessibility features such as ramps, handrails, and stairs. This empowers individuals to make informed decisions about visiting a location and helps foster independence by reducing uncertainties.  

## How We Built It  
- **Gemini API:** Used to power the initial AI model for image-based analysis.  
- **Google AI Studio & Vertex AI:** Trained the model with a diverse set of images, fine-tuning its accuracy to identify accessibility features reliably.  
- **Frontend & Backend Integration:** Seamlessly connected the AI model to an easy-to-use interface for image uploads and results display.  

## Challenges We Faced  
- **Model Precision:** Achieving accurate identification of accessibility features required extensive fine-tuning of the AI model.  
- **API Connectivity:** Encountered intermittent issues with API connections, which were resolved through optimization and testing.  
- **Model Overloading:** Managing large datasets during training required significant effort to balance performance and reliability.  

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
- Successfully built an accessible and intuitive solution that streamlines the process of evaluating public spaces.  
- Automated accessibility analysis, making it easier for individuals with mobility challenges to make decisions about visiting locations.  
- Created a tool that promotes inclusivity and independence, making accessibility assessments faster and more reliable.  

## What We Learned  
- Gained valuable experience in leveraging **Gemini API**, **Google AI Studio**, and **Vertex AI** for developing and fine-tuning AI models.  
- Developed problem-solving skills by overcoming challenges related to model accuracy and connectivity.  
- Learned how to translate personal inspiration into a meaningful, impactful solution for real-world problems.  

## What’s Next for Wheelchair Accessibility Detection  
- **Integration with Mapping Platforms:** Plan to connect the system with mapping applications to provide real-time accessibility data.  
- **3D Map Integration:** Envisioning a future where users can view accessibility features of their destinations on interactive 3D maps.  
- **Enhanced Feature Recognition:** Continuing to improve the model's ability to detect a broader range of accessibility features for more comprehensive assessments.
